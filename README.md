# Runescape-Suity-Level-Max
I've been working on this for a few days, for two reasons. 
To teach myself some programming, and to help my fellow gamers increase their chances for an achievement.

If my code looks terrible, it's because I have no clue what I'm doing.

MiningDemo.rb is designed to work with ctrl+c and ctrl+v in my command prompt, I know no other way of practicing ruby. Who needs cd commands and whatnot anyways? /s on that last bit.  It's also designed to work when I call it, until I tell it to stop with an input of -1. this way I can open the command prompt, irb into ruby, and ctrl-v that miningDemo in there, call it, and sit there and enter in my xp values ~ 50-75 at a time before having it return to me my average damage output and a list of each individual exp input : damage output

thanks, I hate it too :)
